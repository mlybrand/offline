# Offline HTML Application

## Introduction

There is often the need to have a web application that can continue to function even when a network connection is not
available. Some use cases for this need:

* Access from mobile devices with spotty or non-existent network availability
* Work from a laptop in situations without network access
* Need to continue business functions even when the network experiences outages

Given this need, it would be desirable to gain some knowledge and experience in approaches to using current HTML
capabilities to provide such an application.
